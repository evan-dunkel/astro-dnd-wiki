Sumeena has dominion over nature, beasts, druids, and rangers. Her followers act as sentinels of nature protecting the wilds from exploitation, ruin, and destruction. The worship of Sumeena is not very popular in cities, especially those with high levels of urbanization.


## Commandments of Sumeena
* Protect and maintain nature 
* Fight against and destroy those that seek to raze the wilds.
* Do not fear the savagery and unpredictability of nature. Embrace it instead.
