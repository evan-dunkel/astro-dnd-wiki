Jin tends to the Tree of Fate removing branches that need to be culled and cultivating those that continue on. Jin also has dominion over the transition between life and death, helping souls find their way from their bodies to be returned to the Wheel. There are not many followers of Jin and the few that exist are mostly solitary outside of a few exceptions. 

## Commandments of Jin
* Do not meddle with fate; the Tree is sacred and will fight back.
* Death is a natural part of the cycle of life.
* Smite the undead and those that practice necromancy with no mercy.
