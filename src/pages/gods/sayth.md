The masked god of thieves, Sayth, is worshiped by thieves and criminals across Andir. Many of his temples are hidden away or contained within thieves' guilds. He also has domain over assassins and poisons as well as beggars. Sayth encourages his followers to steal from the rich and distribute portions of the spoils to the less fortunate.

## Commandments of Sayth 
* Steal from the rich and give to the poor.
* Be discreet in your actions.
* Strike quickly and efficiently with or without reason.
