Long ago as wars waged between the gods, divine blood was spilled, mixed, and congealed. From this a new Diety emerged, Obi, who hungered for massacre, warfare, and blood. Obiâ€™s followers are mostly mercenaries or soldiers worshiping in hopes of greater prowess on the battlefield.

## Commandments of Obi
* Spill the blood of your enemies.
* Wage war on those weaker than you, show your strength through battle. 
* Instill fear in your foes but show no weakness.
