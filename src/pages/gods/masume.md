Where thunder booms and the waves crash the presence of Masume is felt. Having dominion over storms and the seas, many of Masumeâ€™s followers are sailors and fishermen. During Typhoon season ceremonies are held in coastal towns and cities to give offerings to Masume in exchange for clemency on trade and fishing.

## Commandments of Masume 
* Respect the sea
* Adapt to the circumstances provided to you by the world.
* Be fearless and strongly condemn cowardice. Weather the storm and become stronger.
