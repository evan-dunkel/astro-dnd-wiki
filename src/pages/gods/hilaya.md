Hilaya is the protector of the Dream. She maintains the Dream itself, protects those that are sleeping, and attempts to fight back any rifts that appear in the Dream. Alongside her she has several champions who aid in these tasks, most being Clerics and Paladins that have served her loyally. Hilaya works in opposition with Ulukthai, having to mend the rifts he rips into the fabric of the Dream.

## Commandments of Hilaya
* Artistic expression enriches society and should be encouraged.
* Guide those that find themselves lost and allow them to regain direction.
* Fight against the influence of the abyss.
