Queen of the hells, keeper of oaths, and prolific slaver Beherit is a tyrannical ruler. Also known as the first devil, Beherit was born to Eias as the second deity of Andir. Try as Eias may Beherit was destined to be her counterpart and no effort she made could change the nature of the child. Eventually Eias sealed her child off in the hells where she began her rule and created the first fiends.
