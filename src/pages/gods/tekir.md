God of night, loss, and the protector of orphans, Tekir watches over graveyards and orphanages. His followers worship in the dead of night and usually are employed as morticians, caretakers at orphanages, or gravediggers. Temples of Tekir will provide grief counseling to family members that have lost someone free of charge and also act as the main agencies for adoptions in Andir. 

## Commandments of Tekir
* Have respect for those that have passed.
* Accept that nothing lasts.
* Find solace in the quiet of night.
