Qiblesh, god of greed and coin, is secretly worshiped by many nobles, businessmen, and royals. He encourages his followers to hoard wealth and has a disdain for philanthropic acts. Qiblesh grants boons and additional wealth to his wealthiest followers resulting in competitions  of gluttony between those that worship him.

## Commandments of Qiblesh
* Amass wealth to demonstrate your power and value.
* Take for yourself even if it is at the expense of others.
* Be extravagant in your displays of wealth, all should know of your successes.
