The king of darkness, shadows, and undeath, Yitrik deals in the realms of necromancy and shadow magic. Yitrik has a hatred for the Wheel, believing that once a soul has been formed, the life energy used to make it should belong to that person indefinitely. Yitrik is the patron god of necromancers and liches.

## Commandments of Yitrik 
* There is no sanctity in death, subvert the Wheel as best you can.
* Hide in the shadows and darkness.
* Use the shadows as you see fit to do your bidding.
