Having been betrayed by her sister, Iryuna, many millennia ago, Akkada is the embodiment of vengeance. She was banished to and sealed away in the nine hells to prevent her reprisal; Akkada created chromatic dragons to do her bidding and exert her will on the material plane and thus became the mother of chromatic dragons. Akkada is worshiped by mankind as well, mostly by those that have been wronged by others or society and hold great deals of resentment within their hearts seeking revenge by her guidance.

## Commandments of Akkada
* An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
* Do not forgive, a slight must be punished lest it signal weakness.
* Justice is blind and thus cannot be trusted.
