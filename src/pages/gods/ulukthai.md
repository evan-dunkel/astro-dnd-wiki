The creator of nightmares and shaper of the abyss, Ulukthai was banished to the abyss long ago for reasons absent from even the oldest records. The abyss was specifically created by the other gods to hold Ulukthai away from having influence on any plane. However, Ulukthai was able to tear into the Dream and allow the demons he had created in the Abyss to spill out, some passing through the dream and onto the material plane. 

## Commandments of Ulukthai
* Seed chaos in the world and allow it to fester.
* Topple established systems of law and government in favor of anarchy.
* Destroy but do not craft, for anything crafted can be destroyed.
